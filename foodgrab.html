        A locker takeout service that prioritizes
        COVID safety by reducing transmission risk.
      </h2>

      <h3>Overview /</h3>
      <p>
        For a design course, I
        worked in a team of 3 to
        solve a problem of our
        choosing. We were
        interested in the problem
        space of restaurants
        struggling during COVID.

      <h3>ðŸ’¬ Empathize /</h3>
      <p>
        To understand the needs of
        restaurant owners, my team
        conducted 3 interviews and
        devised a user persona.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Define /</h3>
      <p>
        Our problem statement
        summarized our user needs and
        the intent of our design.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ’­ Ideate /</h3>
      <p>
        My team ideated several
        concepts and evaluated
        how well they satisfied
        our user needs.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ“± Prototype /</h3>
      <p>
        Now committed to our food
locker idea, we assigned 1
member to work on the
locker prototype while 2
of us built wireframes.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ¥½ Test /</h3>
      <p>
        With a stakeholder, I conducted a usability test with 3
essential tasks and received feedback (example below).
      </p>

      <h3>Outcomes /</h3>
      <img src="assets/img/foodgrab/mocks.png" alt="app mockups">
      <p>
        By the end of our 6-week sprint,
my team delivered a Figma prototype (21 screens), physical prototype, and 10-minute presentation. Our next steps would be to assemble a team of engineers to
build an MVP and reach out to
restaurants to adopt Food Grab.
